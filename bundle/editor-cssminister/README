CSSMinister provides key mappings that convert any hexadecimal, RGB or HSL color values from one format to another.  The mappings fall into two categories:  1) those that change the next matching color only, and 2) those that change all colors matching the requested format in the current file.

Mappings that change formats one color at a time include:

  ,xr - hexadecimal to RGB
  ,xh - hexadecimal to HSL
  ,rx - RGB to hexadecimal
  ,rh - RGB to HSL
  ,hx - HSL to hexadecimal
  ,hr - HSL to RGB
  ,kx - color keyword to hexadecimal
  ,kr - color keyword to RGB
  ,kh - color keyword to HSL

Mappings that change all colors matching the requested color format:

  ,axr - all hexadecimal to RGB
  ,axh - all hexadecimal to HSL
  ,arx - all RGB to hexadecimal
  ,arh - all RGB to HSL
  ,ahx - all HSL to hexadecimal
  ,ahr - all HSL to RGB
  ,akx - all color keywords to hexadecimal
  ,akr - all color keywords to RGB
  ,akh - all color keywords to HSL

This script was tested with CSS, Sass and Less stylesheets.  However, it is possible that it may work anywhere CSS color values are used.
